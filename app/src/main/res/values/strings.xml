    <string name="test_begin_header">About test</string>
    <string name="test_begin_description">Thank you for taking the test!
        \n\nYou have to complete a number of simple tasks to interact with a mobile device through interface elements.
        \n\nAs mentioned earlier, while you are taking the test, the application will collect and process information from motion sensors.
        \n\nThanks to the collected and processed information from the sensors of the mobile device, your personal and unique user model will be formed.
        \n\nThe meaning of the experiment is precisely to find out how unique the user models are and what the effectiveness of the authentication method being developed will be.
        \n\nWhile you were reading this text, the system was working and has already begun to form your unique model.
        \n\nHowever, it needs more information, which it will receive while you complete the tasks.
        \n\nCompleting tasks will not take much time, because the average time to complete all tasks takes about 5 minutes.
        \n\n<b>Please note that during the test you need to pass at one time, without switching applications and without turning off the phone!</b> This is due to the fact that your user model changes throughout the all test and will be recorded only at the very end!
        \n\nTo start the test, as well as to move on to subsequent tasks, please click \'next task\' button.</string>
    <string name="test_end_header">The test is completed</string>
    <string name="test_end_description">The last task is to save the test results. Please click on the \'save test results\' button.
        \n\nThe generated model will be saved to a plain text file, for which you can choose the name and folder in which it will be saved. If you have a desire, you can easily get acquainted with the contents of this file.
        \n\nAfter the data is recorded in a file, please send the saved file to the organizers of the experiment.
        \n\nThank you for passing the test!</string>
